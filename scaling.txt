You're off to a great start — you already have the **core services** distributed across technologies (Node + Spring Boot) and you've implemented **three roles: USER, SELLER, and ADMIN**, which is realistic and production-aligned.

Let’s evaluate what you have, what’s missing, and what you should consider **adding or enhancing**.

## ✅ Your Current Services

| Domain            | Service                               | Tech             | Status |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| **Auth**          | NextAuth.js + Spring (JWT)            | Next.js + Spring | ✅      | done 
| **Client**        | Next.js frontend                      | Next.js          | ✅      |
| **Orders**        | Order Service                         | Node + Express   | ✅      |in progress

| **Cart**          | Cart Service                          | Spring Boot      | ✅      | not strated
| **Notifications** | Notification Service (Email/SMS/Push) | Node + Express   | ✅      | not started

So far, you're **70% feature-complete** for a production-grade distributed e-commerce system. Now, here’s what you **should consider adding or validating**:

---

## 🔍 Services You *Might* Still Need

### 1. **Inventory Service** (Recommended)

> 🧠 *Separate inventory control and stock logic from product and order services.*

* ✅ Real-time stock updates on order placement/cancellation
* ✅ Reserve stock temporarily during checkout
* ✅ Reject orders when out of stock
* ✅ Allow sellers to update stock

✅ If your **product service already handles stock**, this is optional — but **separating it improves scalability**.

---

### 2. **Review & Rating Service** (Recommended)

> 🧠 *Let users leave reviews on purchased products.*

* Users rate/review after purchase
* Seller/product ratings calculated
* Admin can moderate inappropriate reviews

✅ Adds **trust, social proof, and seller feedback loop.**

---

### 3. **Search Service** (Optional, but improves UX)

> 🧠 *Search, filter, and sort products using keywords or tags.*

* Full-text search
* Fuzzy matching
* Filters (price range, seller, category)
* Powered by **Elasticsearch** (if needed)

✅ If your current `/products` endpoint doesn’t scale well with filtering/sorting, consider this.

---

### 4. **Analytics / Admin Dashboard API** (Optional but resume-worthy)

> 🧠 *Metrics and dashboards for admin users.*

* Sales data, top-selling products
* Seller performance
* Order trends
* Product popularity

✅ Very useful for **admin roles** and adds serious weight to your resume.

---

### 5. **Discount/Coupon Service** (Optional)

> 🧠 *Apply coupons or promo codes.*

* Fixed/percentage discounts
* Validity and usage limits
* Applied at cart or order time

✅ Great real-world logic. Use it in payment/cart/order flow.

---

### 6. **Audit/Activity Log Service** (Optional, advanced)

> 🧠 *Track actions for debugging, rollback, or audit.*

* Logs changes: product edit, price update, stock movement
* Especially useful for ADMIN role

| Admin Dashboard API | 🔶           | Add for analytics, charts                  |
| Coupon/Discount     | 🔶           | Optional but realistic                     |
| Audit Log           | ❌ (Advanced) | Only if you're aiming for a very pro build |

## 💡 Recommendation

If your goal is:

* 🧑‍💻 **Resume/project portfolio** → Add **Review**, basic **Search**, and an **Analytics/Dashboard API**
* 🏢 **Startup-grade design** → Add **Inventory**, **Audit**, and **Coupon Service**
* 🎯 **Job in backend/SDE2+** → Add **Inventory**, **Search**, and **Kafka/RabbitMQ** for inter-service communication
